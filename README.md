# LibraryManagement
A Simple command-line-based system to manage a libraryâ€™s book collection. This system will operate locally and allow users to perform essential operations such as adding, viewing, searching, and borrowing/returning books. The goal is to apply object-oriented programming principles along with file-based data persistence.

This is a **Library Management System** built using Python. The system provides basic functionality for managing a library's books and users. It runs through the command line and allows users to perform operations such as adding books, borrowing books, returning books, viewing available books and also save data in the form of book.txt.
