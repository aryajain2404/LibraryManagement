# LibraryManagement
simple command-line-based system to manage a libraryâ€™s book collection. This system will operate locally and allow users to perform essential operations such as adding, viewing, searching, and borrowing/returning books. The goal is to apply object-oriented programming principles along with file-based data persistence.
